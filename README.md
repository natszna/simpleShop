# simpleShop

This is my first project which I made using Spring, mySQL and JPA to name a few. 

It's simple shop where users can log in and log out, 
they can add products to their basket (which is kept in session) and later they can order them. 

What is more, users can edit their profiles and add products to the shop. 
It is also possible to visit the page as a guest, where you can see only available products.

In this project you can also log in as an administrator which gives you possibility to edit informations about users.
